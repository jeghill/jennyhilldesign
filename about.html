            <h1 >Hi, I'm Jenny</h1>
            <p>I am a UX/UI Designer and Researcher passionate about user-centered design.</p>
            <p>I graduated from University of Birmingham in 2022 with 1st Class Honours in Liberal Arts and Sciences. In my final year I took an entrepreneurial start-up module which introduced me to design thinking. I loved the fast-paced nature of it and after doing some research I realised that a job in UX fits my career goals of variety, collaboration and seeing an outcome. I then enrolled on a six-month bootcamp to increase my UX knowledge further.</p>
            <p>I am currently doing an internship within the IT Services department of the University of Birmingham. My primary focus is analysing qualitative and quantitative digital experience survey data and as part of this I have made Power BI reports. I have also participated the MyUoB student app sprints and am in the process of seeing what improvements I can make to staff and student digital experiences during the rest of my internship (universities don't operate in an agile manner!)</p>
            <p>I really enjoy seeing the whole design process of a project from the initial research phase to the ideation, prototyping and testing of designs. I also have experience in information architecture and am code conversational, I built this website myself. </p>
            <p>I have gained strong communication and teamwork skills whilst working at summer camps and further developed my empathy and composure when working at the university accommodation department. Throughout my interdisciplinary degree I enjoyed combining academic processes from different subjects and working with people with different specialisms to answer complex problems.</p>
            <p>For my university dissertation I designed a zine (homemade magazine) about the anthropocene (a new human induced geological age) which is now in libraries across the UK. You can read more about my zine making <a href="https://linktr.ee/jennymakeszines" target="_blank">here</a>. In my free time I love to travel, play tennis and go to museums and galleries.</p>
