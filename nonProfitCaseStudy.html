A design guide was then built based on the tone requirements from Lyn, the CEO, as cheerful, friendly playful and sunny. UI elements including navigation and pet cards were designed.</p>

                <p>GO OVER THIS TEXT! I interviewed the stakeholder after we had done the majority of the research phase. It was during this interview I realised I had forgotten about the other needs of the charity and other patrons who might not have enough space for a pet or who have already adopted but still want to support the charity in other ways. There was not enough time to complete thorough user research on the donation function of the website.</p>
